# Prediction-using-Machine-Learning-Models
Mr. John Hughes would like to figure out which is the best model to use to predict if a person is likely to suffer from diabetes or not, by using the diabetes dataset.

Mr. John Hughes suggested following Machine learning model algorithms, In which the machine learns from the data just like humans learn from their experiences. 
Machine learning allows computers to find hidden insights without being explicitly programmed.
These 3 algorithms fall under the Supervised Learning type, used here for classification challenges.

1.Support Vector Machines
2.Logistical Regression
3.Decision Tree
